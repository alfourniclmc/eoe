2D cross-platform RPG

This is my firt real project of this scope.

The goal of this project is to be entirely modular, allowing for
greater versatility when adding or removing features of the game.

Some notable features include:

* Unique textures, music, and other assets
* Roguelike features and world interaction
* Classic RPG Combat
* Character Classes and Specializations
* Shops, Markets, and working Economy
